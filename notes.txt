** Everything in python is object **
*** Every object contains set of methods ***


number
--------
number can be integer or decimal or octal or hexa.

aval = 10
bval = 34.32


string
--------
string is defined in single or double or triple quotes.

aname = 'python programming'
bname = "java programming"
cname = """hadoop"""


list ( like an array)
-----
list contains set of elements.
Elements can be numbers or strings or any combination.
list elements are defined in []

alist = [10,20,30,40]
blist = ["unix",43,2,"java"]



tuple ( immutable , unchangeable , uneditable)
-----
tuple contains set of elements.
Elements can be numbers or strings or any combination.
tuple elements are defined in ().
*** Elements inside tuple cannot be modified directly ***


atup = (34,23,3.34,"java")

# list of lists
empdata = [['ram','1-1-1990','M'],['rita','2-2-1990,'F],[]]
# list of tuples
empdata = [('ram','1-1-1990','M'),('rita','2-2-1990,'F),()]




dictionary ( hashmap hash json )
------------------------------
dictionary contains elements in the form of keys and values.
In dictionary .. key can be number or string used to uniquely identify the value.
               value can be number or string or list or tupe or dictionary or set or complex data structure

syntax:   object = { key:value , key:value , key:value ....}
exampe:     book =    {'chap1':10 , 'chap2':20 ,'chap3':30}
           bookinfo = {'chap1':[10,'Rita','UK'] , 'chap2':[20,'Ram','US'] }



set
------
set is unordered collection of unique values of the same type.

aset = {10,10,20,30,30,30}


file handling in python
-----------------------------

There are 2 types of files
- flat files ( .csv   txt conf log  tsv )
- third party files ( xlsx docx pdf ppt xml zip rar tar gz tar.gz )

opening the file
---------------------
syntax:   object = open(filename,mode)
example:    fobj = open('abc.txt','r')  # read mode
            fobj = open('abc.txt','w')  # write mode
            fobj = open('abc.txt','a')  # append mode



close the file
----------------
fobj.close()

read operation
-------------
- reading the file line by line using file object
- obj.readlines()
- obj.read()
- read the file using csv library
- using pandas library
- json library
- openpyxl library




exception handling
------------------

There are 2 types of errors

- syntax error
- semantic error

handling the errors during the runtime is known as exception handling.


try
except
else
finally
raise


























library | module | package
-------------------------------------------
Every library contains some set of methods of some particular task.

There are 2 types of libraries

- builtin libraries( builtin libraries which are generally used are installed with python)
- third party libraries( depending on the requirement developer has to install the third party library )

How to install the third party library ?
----------------

-installing using pip tool ( pip tool downloads and installs the library )
- downloading and installing library manually from www.pypi.org



programming
----------------
-procedural programming ( top down programming)
-object oriented programming



object oriented programming principles
------------------------------------
-class and object
- data hiding
- escapsulation
- inheritance
- polymorphism


class
------
class is just like blueprint of the house.
Every class contains data members(variables) and member functions.(methods)

object
------
object is the instance of the class


self
-----
self is the instance of the object
